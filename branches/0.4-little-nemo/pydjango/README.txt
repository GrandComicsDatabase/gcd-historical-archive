This is a new implementation of the Grand Comics Database in Python
using the Django framework.

See the Technical section at http://docs.comics.org/ for platform-specific
setup instructions, a guide to the project structure, and other important
documents.

Please join the gcd-tech list for help and to find out where we could use
your contributions.  http://groups.google.com/group/gcd-tech/

To report bugs or find bugs to work on:
    http://dev.comics.org/bugs/

    * Bugs in the NEW state are available for work.
    * Bugs in the ASSIGNED state are being worked on.

    Be sure to "Accept" a bug to put it in the ASSIGNED state
    before you start working on it.  Unlike in many Bugzilla installations,
    "Accept"ing a bug will automatically reassign it to you.

    If you are unfamiliar with the code, contact the gcd-tech list
    before starting to submit fixes.
