This is a new implementation of the Grand Comic-Book Database in Python
using the Django framework.

For basic information, see the README file in the project's root directory.
This file explains the specifics of setting up a development environment
on MacOS X (10.4 or 10.5, at least in theory).

To run:

0.  You'll need Python.  This code was developed with Python 2.4 in order
to be compatible with the last version of MySQLdb (1.2.1) that was pre-compiled
for MacOS.  Current versions of MySQLdb do not compile on all versions
of MacOS.  More details on this later.


1.  Install Django (http://www.djangoproject.com).  Get the source
from Subversion as of revision 7835 for best results (this number will
move forward as relevant patches to Django are checked in- if you try a
later revision and it works please update the docs an notify the GCD-Tech
mailing list).


2.  Install MySQL (version 5.0.45 has been used with this code).  Load a
data dump of the GCD database into MySQL (ask the tech list for help
if you don't already know how to get such a dump).  The most recent dump
as of this writing is missing the Indexer and/or IndexCredit tables.  Send
email to GCD-Tech and someone can get you the missing data (with passwords
removed).


3.  Install the MySQLdb Python module from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python

You may need to downgrade to Python 2.4 and use
a slightly older version of MySQLdb due to bug 1768305 (in the SourceForge
bug-tracking system), which applies to Python 2.5 despite saying 2.4 in the
title.  Yes, that's confusing.  There's also bug 1821021 about MacOS 10.4
compilation.  There is a page that maintains pre-compiled
Python packages for MacOS that has one for Python 2.4 but not 2.5:
http://pythonmac.org/packages/py24-fat/index.html
This is what I used, and I recommend it- the last release of MySQLdb was
more than a year ago (Feb 2007) so I'm not holding my breath wating for
the compile problems to be fixed.

If you're feeling brave, this page on installing Django:
http://tinyurl.com/2sq4x7
(which is on a Ruby site for some reason) has instructions on how to
get MySQLdb  compiling for Python 2.5.


4.  Put the src/ directory of this project on your Python path.


5.  Open up src/gcd/settings.py


6.  From the src/gcd/ directory, run

python manage.py runserver

and then take a look at http://127.0.0.1:8000/gcd/

If you don't get any page at all, check www.djangoproject.com if it
looks like Django isn't configured correctly, or
http://maelstrom.walton.uark.edu/bugzilla/ and/or handrews@users.sourceforge.net
if it appears to be a code problem.
