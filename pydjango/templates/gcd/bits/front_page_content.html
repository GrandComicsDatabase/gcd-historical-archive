<span class="important">To get started, enter some terms in the search box above.</span>  Keep in mind that the search string is interpreted literally, including punctuation.  So <em>All Star</em> and <em>All-Star</em> are two different searches, and <em>Justice America</em> won't match <em>Justice Society of America</em>.  We plan to implement modern keyword-driven search as soon as we can (which means in the first half of 2010).

  <dt><span class="important">NEW!</span> Start page in different languages
  <dd>The GCD always had a broad international base and we now strengthen this by introducing start pages in other languages. First is a German language one, the link you can find on the right under useful links. Other languages will follow in the next couple of weeks. These localized start pages contain basic information about the GCD, localized statistics and last updated boxes.

  <dt>Users can make changes directly in the data
  <dd>Anyone (after registration) can make changes directly themselves (subject to approval, of course).  Do you have something that the GCD hasn't indexed, or doesn't even have listed, but haven't felt like writing it up in an Error Report?  Well, you can edit or add the information directly on a copy of the data, submitting it for approval to an editor.  Go fix a typo that's been driving you crazy!  To become an indexer use the automatic registration process.
 
  <dt>Import for issue data
  <dd>You can also import the data for an issue into our database from a tab-separated text file. This typically concerns existing data you might have in some database or spreadsheet. More information about the file format is <a href="http://docs.comics.org/wiki/Indexing_Offline">available</a>.

  <dt>Cover uploading
  <dd>The contribution of covers is integrated into the regular online indexing and approval process. Therefore one has to be logged in for cover uploading. Note that the stacked covers currently in our system need to be replaced, any help is appreciated.

  <dt>View of series data
  <dd>We recently added two additional views for a series. The series detail page lists one issue per row, in the standard sort order. The series timeline arranges the issues with a minimum of one row per month.  Assuming normal and correct key dates, the issues from the series appear spaced along the timeline based on their cover dates.

  <dt>Ability to search for unindexed issues or missing covers
  <dd>Using Advanced Search, you can search for issues that haven't yet been indexed (after setting Search For to Issues, under Issue Fields, use Has Stories).  And you can search for issues with missing covers or ones that need to be replaced (after setting Search For to Issues, under Issue Fields, use Cover is Needed).  (You likely will want to limit the search by publisher or some field too.)

  <dt>Some recently added concepts and fields
  <dd>We recently added some new concepts.  These are cover Brands (such as Marvel Knights), and Indicia Publishers (such as National Periodical Publications, Inc.) for each issue (in conjunction with the main publisher, such as DC).  Other changes include separating out the issue data from the cover data, so that they have separate page counts and notes (although for now, notes may be duplicated until they are cleaned up) and proper use of the Volume field along with the issue number (although again, odd data may remain until it is cleaned up properly).

<h3>Short term future plans (first half of 2010)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Linking of reprints back to the original (or forward to the reprint)
</ul>
<h3>Longer term future plans (second half of 2010 or later)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Continued improvements to Advanced Search, including using external tools to gain functionality such as fuzzy matches.
  <li>Coding to a new database design (already mostly worked out), with changes like:
    <ul>
      <li>The ability to have an issue appear in more than one series (for dual numbered books such as Star Wars: Empire / Star Wars: Rebellion, and for flip books).
      <li>The ability to have different cover titles and indicia titles for the same book (for titles such as "Captain America: Reborn" vs "Reborn")
      <li>More tailored separation between periodicals and books (present more logically)
    </ul>
    <li>User preferences: The ability to tailor what information is shown (such as only story content, non-story but no ad content, etc.)
    <li>Translation of the full website
</ul>
