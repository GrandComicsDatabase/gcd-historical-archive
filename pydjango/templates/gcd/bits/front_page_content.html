<h3>New Features for July 2011!</h3>
Changes visible to all
<ul>
  <li> Added issue variants. This mainly concerns issues with different covers,
be it with different artwork, price, barcode, brand, etc. Issue variants will fetch
most story sequences from its 'base' issue, but they can have their own cover sequence
if the artwork is different from the base issue.
  <li> On the series page we now show the used brands and indicia publishers.
  <li> Barcode support: We added a field to track UPC/EAN numbers.
  <li> Issue titles: For European series or TPB series one now can enter an issue title in addition to the issue number.
  <li> Leading articles are now correctly handled for sorting without moving them to the back of the series name.
  <li> Added an uncertain flag for series years.
</ul>
Changes visible for indexers
<ul>
  <li> New editing functionality for variant issues. There most likely will be questions how the issue variants work in detail, if you are an indexer you might want to join our main mailing list for a while for more information.
  <li> ISBNs, barcodes, issue titles and indicia frequency can now be turned off for a series.
  <li> Added corresponding no_fields for ISBN, indicia frequency, barcode, issue title.
  <li> Added help links to the editing page for all fields, experienced users can turn these off in their profile.
  <li> Changed order of fields on the editing pages, field orders are now consistent on edit and compare pages.
