Welcome to the {{ site_name }}!
<p>
You are now registered as a new Indexer!  Please consider signing up for our
main <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/gcd-main">mailing list</a> or
one of the <a href="http://docs.comics.org/wiki/Email_Lists_FAQ#International_mailing_lists">
international ones</a>.
</p>
<p>
As a new user, while you may upload as many covers as you like, you are 
initially limited to making one data change and must wait for this one 
to be approved before you can do more. This is to allow an 
<a href="http://docs.comics.org/wiki/List_of_editors">Editor</a>,
who will be assigned as your mentor after your first submission, to help 
you and answer any questions with your first few data contributions. 
<p>
The number of data changes you can make at a time will automatically increase
starting with your first approval, after which you can also reserve all new
issues in a series as well as making changes one issue at a time.
<p>
You can see your current maximum allowed changes on your
<a href="{% url default_profile %}">profile page</a>.
