Character Appearances: Suggestions for a Controlled List

 * Please let me know if this is the right place to post it.
 * The new schema moves appearance types from freeform to a list.
 * This recommendation is based off a May 2007 dump of the database.

This RFC is also available at (and will change with suggestions):

 http://www.disobey.com/vcs/?p=gcd.git;a=blob;f=internal/appearance_types.txt

What follows is a draft request for comment for the static list of
Character Appearance Types, as needed for the new database schema. It
has been created by looking for all usages of parenthesis in the
stories.Char_App database column, then normalizing the results.

The biggest concern with some of the rarer appearance types below
(such as "Appearance: Image" or "Appearance: Timeshifted") is that
they may just be considered a "Cameo" by current indexers. We have
far more "Cameo" entries and I suspect that some of those entries
would be better reclassified. That's a scary amount of work, so it
might be saner to just rollup the lesser appearances into Cameo.

It also seems that one appearance should be able to be classified
under multiple types - obscured in a flashback, a flashback to a
timeshifted event, etc. Checkboxes in the UI would work here.

Most notably absent from this list is "villain".


 * Cameo
 * Death
 * False appearance
 * Flashback
 * Guest appearance
 * Host
 * Image only
 * Incorporeal
 * Introduction
 * Obscured
 * Origin
 * Timeshifted


Cameo
-----
  The character makes a brief appearance, either as a speaking
  or intermediary role, or in the background of a scene. This is
  a catch-all type for minor roles: if the character falls more
  specifically under another type, use that instead.

  REPLACES: 'c', 'cameo in prologue', 'cameos', 'in background',
  'last page cameo'.

  CONCERNS: Should cameos be used for visual appearances, or
  could it also double for "mentioned", "mentioned only", and
  "mention", which are presumably just named appearances (either
  through dialogue or newspaper headlines, perhaps). What about
  "out of costume" instances? "Voice only"?


Death
-----
  The character has "died" in this story. The interpretation of
  death is quite liberal here: we know most characters have a chance
  of coming back to life, but it could also refer to deconstruction,
  dismantled, or destruction.

  REPLACES: 'd', 'd?', 'd--twice', 'dead', 'death?', 'death of',
  'death of in this issue', 'destroyed', 'die', 'dies', 'dies again',
  'dies?', 'dies in this issue', 'dies in this story', 'killed',
  'killed in this story'.

  CONCERNS: There's one type currently labeled as "deceased". It
  is unclear if the character has deceased in this story, or if
  the character is a zombie (or zombie image). Likewise, there's
  "corpse" and "as a corpse". Which is animate and which isn't?


False appearance
----------------
  The character appears to be in this story, but it is actually a
  false or fake version, such as a clone, robot, doppleganger, or
  someone attempting a disguise of the character in question.

  REPLACES: 'as a balloon', 'as a robot', 'clone', 'clone of
  peter parker', 'doppleganger', 'false', 'fake', 'imposter',
  'in puppet form', "peter parker's clone", 'superboy clone',
  'robot version'.

  CONCERNS: 'changeling'?


Flashback
---------
  The character appears in a flashback (as a cameo or not).

  REPLACES: 'cameo flashback', 'cameo-flashback', 'cameo- flashback'.
  'cameo in flashback', 'fb', 'f/b', 'flashback cameo', 'flashback
  only', 'flashbacks', 'in a flashback', 'in fb', 'in flashback',
  'in flashback story'.


Guest appearance
----------------
  The character plays a more important role than merely a "cameo".

  REPLACES: 'guest', 'guest-star', 'guest star', 'guest stars'.

  CONCERNS: Could "host" be considered a guest appearance?


Host
----
  The character is hosting or telling the narrative that follows.

  REPLACES: 'host - inserted', 'story host'.

  CONCERNS: Could be considered a "guest appearance".


Image only
----------
  The character appears on a TV, computer screen or other digital
  device, or a poster, pamphlet, letterhead, photos, etc. This would
  also cover character appearances in mirrors, windows, or other
  reflecting surfaces.

  REPLACES: 'character in movie', 'film', 'foto', 'image',
  'in background picture', 'in photo', 'on a poster', 'on poster', 'on tv',
  'on video', 'photo', 'picture', 'picture in foreground', 'poster',
  'tv image', 'on a comic book cover', 'on watch face'.

  CONCERNS: Could just be a "cameo". Could "statue", "statuette"
  and "trophy bust" fit here?


Incorporeal
--------------
  The character appears in a non-physical form such as in a dream
  sequence, as an illusion or hallucination, or as a spirit such
  as a ghost. Contrast this with "Image only", which is the
  character's physical presence projected on something else.

  REPLACES: 'dream', 'dream appearance', 'dream cameo', 'dream
  sequence', 'ghost', 'hallucination', 'illusion', 'in dream', 
  'in a dream'.'


Introduction
------------
  The character's first appearance in a physical book. This would
  also be used if this is the character's only known appearance
  (just like we can't expect a character ever to really die, we
  can't expect a character to only ever have one appearance).

  REPLACES: '1st', '1st app.',  '1st appearance', '1st full',
  '1st and intro', 'debut', 'first', 'first appearance', 'first
  full appearance', 'i', 'only app.', 'first and only known appearance
  to date', 'intro', 'introduction and only appearance',
  'only appearance'.

  CONCERNS: We have a 'new' in our current database that may be
  the same thing, but could also be equivalent to 'joins'.


Obscured
--------
  The character is recognizable, but obscured in some way. The
  character may be in disguise, in the shadows, or as a recognizable
  silhouette.

  REPLACES: 'disguised', 'face unseen', 'in shadow', 'in shadows',
  'in silhouette only', 'in disguise', 'in the shadows', 'obscured',
  'shadow', 'silhouette', 'silhouette only'.

  CONCERNS: Could just be a "cameo".


Origin
------
  The character's origin story is being told or retold, or more
  details are being revealed. The origin need not be complete -
  brief or partial origins also apply.

  REPLACES: 'brief origin', 'full origin', 'o', 'o details',
  'origin recap', 'origin retold', 'origin retold in detail',
  'origin revealed', 'partial origin', 'retold', 'retold w/ details',
  'retold in detail', 'retold in fb', 'text origin'.


Timeshifted
-----------
  The character appears in a younger or older form than we've
  come to expect, perhaps as a baby, child, or older man.
  This category would also cover appearances of the character
  from the future or the past.

  REPLACES: 'as an adult', 'as a baby', 'as a boy',
  'as a child', 'baby'.

  CONCERNS: Could just be a "cameo".
